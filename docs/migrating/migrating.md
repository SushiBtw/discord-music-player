# Migrating to Discord Music Player v8

### Note: Version 8 has some breaking changes, your old code from Version 7 will not longer work.

The **Version 8** update brings support for [Discord.js v13](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js), new features and better Queue management.
We use the new [@discordjs/voice](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/voice) package, that makes the music even better!

## Code example

Every function related to Music is now a part of `Queue`.
You need to create a new `Queue` instance to interact with the Guild music.

```diff
- player.play(message, search);
+ let queue = player.createQueue(message.guild.id);
+ await queue.join(message.member.voice.channel);
+ let song = await queue.play(search);
```

## Event management

The **Version 8** removes `message` object, from the play parameters.
Discord Music Player methods accept now `GuildResolvable` (`Guild`/`GuildID`) discord.js object.

Instead of the `message` object, you can pass custom `<Queue>.data` or `<Song>.data` option to hold custom data.

```js
let queue = player.createQueue(interaction.guild.id, {
  data: interaction,
});
await queue.join(message.member.voice.channel);
await queue.play("F1 music", {
  data: { custom: "fields" },
});
```

The `data` object will be always accessible for you under the `<Queue>.data` prop.

```js
player.on("songAdd", (queue, song) => {
  queue.data.channel.send(`**${song}** has been added to the queue.`);
  console.log(`Song custom data: ${song.data}`); // { custom: 'fields' }
});
player.on("queueEnd", (queue) => {
  queue.data.channel.send(`Queue ended, there is nothing to play.`);
});
```

## Utils

From the Discord Music Player **Version 8**, you can access some Utils functions, such as `search()` or `best()`.

### Search

Search util allows you to search for songs, allow you to pick the best search and play it.

```js
const { Utils } = require("discord-music-player");

let queue = player.getQueue(message.guild);

// Search for songs
let search = await Utils.search(
  "F1 music",
  {
    sortBy: "view count", // Custom options
  },
  queue, // Queue object
  10 // Search limit
);

// Play the 3rd searched song
await queue.play(search[2]);
```

### Best

Best util allows you to search for the best song, use the method how you want.

```js
const { Utils } = require("discord-music-player");

let queue = player.getQueue(message.guild);

// Search for best song
let best = await Utils.best(
  "F1 music",
  {
    sortBy: "view count", // Custom options
  },
  queue // Queue object
);

message.channel.send(`Best F1 music so far: ${best.name} (${best.url})`);
```

## Errors

The Discord Music Player **Version 8** added a custom `DMPError` object, that is thrown while an error occurred while calling a method.
While catching errors in async methods is easy, using the `.catch()` tag - you would need to use the `try...catch` statement in non-async methods.

**Every error will return a custom [DMPError](https://discord-music-player.js.org/docs/main/development/class/DMPError) object.**
List of Error Code's can be found [here](https://discord-music-player.js.org/docs/main/development/typedef/DMPErrors).

### Play (async)

```js
let queue = client.player.createQueue(message.guild.id);
await queue.join(message.member.voice.channel);
let song = await queue.play(args.join(" ")).catch((err) => {
  console.log(err.name); // UnknownVoice
  console.log(err.message); // The provided Member is not in a Voice Channel.
});
```

### Skip (non-async)

The error shown here can exist while the Queue ended,
but due the `QueueOptions#timeout` - the bot did not leave (so the Queue existed, but was locally destroyed) at the time the method was not called.

```js
let queue = client.player.getQueue(message.guild.id);
if (!queue) return;
try {
  queue.skip();
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err.name); // QueueDestroyed
  console.log(err.message); // The Queue was destroyed.
}
```

## Event Errors

The `play()/playlist()` error handling does not longer emit the `Player#error` event ([read here](#Errors)).
You need to handle Event Errors (happening in runtime) by yourself now.

Here is an example:

```js
player.on("error", (error, queue) => {
  queue.data.channel.send(`An error occurred: \`${error.message}\`.`);
});
```

## New Play Options

You can now pass few new Play options such as:

- `timecode: boolean` - If this option is true, it will seek to the url time param (?t=) moment,
- `localAddress: string` - If this option is provided, it will use the provided IP address to search and play the song.

```js
let queue = client.player.createQueue(message.guild.id);
await queue.join(message.member.voice.channel);
let song = await queue.play("F1 music", {
  timecode: true,
  localAddress: "CustomIPv6YouOwn",
});
```
